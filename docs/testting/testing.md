Testing
=======

The default test suite of the boilerplate uses `mocha` as the testing framework and `chai` for the assertions in combo with `sinon` (standalone test spies, stubs and mocks). They are located in the test folder in the root of the project and follow the same folder structure as the `src` folder, except for functional test.
